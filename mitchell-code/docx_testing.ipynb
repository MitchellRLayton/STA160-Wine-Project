the equal of 1945 Unfortunately the crop was about half the normal size The grapes were well-nourished resulting in concentrated wines rich in every quality including color body bouquet and fruit They are the most long-lived wines of our generation in the classic tradition 20 out of a possible 20 very very great\" There is little that we can add to this other than to say that the 1961s have gone up 40% in Bordeaux during the last year if one is fortunate enough to be able to obtain any of the great ones at all 1961 VINTAGE No Bottle Case 237 CHATEAU BELAIR (St Emilion) 4.49 48.50 There are 12 First Great Growths in the 1955 St Emilion official classification Chateau Belair is one of them The vineyard is owned by Chateau Ausone the vines are adjacent and the wine is matured in the Ausone cellar The distinction between Belair and Ausone can be detected only by the most professional taster 566 CHATEAU SIRAN (Margaux) 4.49 48.50 A noble vineyard in Margaux that has been saluted in the Time-Life wine book as one of the 11 Medoc vineyards worthy of being ranked with the growths recognized in the 1855 classification Owned by Alain Miailhe proprietor of Pichon Longueville Lalande and co-proprietor of Chateau Palmer A truly great Claret at relatively modest cost 434 CHATEAU PRIEURE LICHINE (Margaux) 4.49 48.50 Alexis Lichine also produced Chateau Lascombes which sells for the bottle In 1961 I do believe that Mr Lichine has produced a wine in the same league as Lascombes itself Sensationally priced at only $4.49 595 CHATEAU LYNCH SAGES (Pauillac) 4.79 51.75 5th-growth Medoc-originally the property of an Irishman Mr Lynch who was Mayor of Bordeaux Rich full round 288 CHATEAU BRANE CANTENAC (Margaux) 5.09 55.00 For a while this great vineyard a second-growth Medoc languished but under the dedicated creative leadership of the proprietor Lucien Lurton it has flourished to a point where its delicacy and softness and bouquet puts it among the first-rank in Margaux 630 CHATEAU LEO VILLE LASCASES (St Julien) 5.49 59.30 The vinyard stretches from the town of St Julien to the borders of Chateau Latour Produces almost 20000 cases of truly excellent wine each year However in 1961 they were able to make only 9000 cases of concentrated superb long-lived wine 804 CHATEAU CANON (St Emilion) 5.49 59.30 A \\'first great growth\\' of St Emilion Soft generous with considerable finesse 615 CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE (St Julien) 5.99 64.70 Proudly owned by M Achille-Fould former Minister of Agriculture The wine has developed a world reputation for excellence and prestige thus making it one of the most expensive wines of Bordeaux 114 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR (St Estephe) 5.99 64.70 Quality at the expense of quantity is the standard procedure at Calon Segur Thus the wine is slow to mature it is perhaps the most long-lived of all and it has achieved a special kind of wine immortality in 1961 10 No Bottle Case 584 CARRUADES DE CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 8.95 96.75 Many believe this second wine of Chateau Lafite Rothschild from the same soil is showing better today than Lafite itself because of quicker maturation A fantastic Claret 568 CHATEAU LA

spiraling price graph of the other great \\'61 Clarets In the same league as Cheval Blanc \\'61 but not much more than half the price 207 CHATEAU MARGAUX (Margaux) 13.50 145.80 A handsome colonnaded Chateau was built in about 1820 by a pupil of Victor Louis architect of the Bordeaux Opera House It is now owned by the Ginestet family who have restored its magnificence Very elegant beautifully balanced relatively quick to develop reach great heights in 1961 158 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) 14.50 156.60 The vineyard is owned by Clarence Dillon and his son Douglas Dillon formerly our Secretary

vineyards of California are presently producing markedly better red and white wines than they did five years ago Rather than rely on hearsay we decided to see for ourselves thus we tasted our way through the better vineyards of Napa Sonoma Livermore and Santa Clara We were amazed by the vast recent plantings of the noble grape varieties such as Pinot Chardonnay Johannisberg Riesling Cabernet Sauvignon Pinot Note Gewurz-traminer and Sauvignon Blanc—the more shy-yielding grapes that produce in Europe the great Bordeaux Burgundies and Rhines We conducted comparative tastings with the growers present and the conversation was reminiscent of the pleasant verbal arguments that take place in Bordeaux as the owners of Chateau Haut Brion Chateau Margaux and Chateau Petrus taste and compare their wines of the same vintage year The conversation was as informative as dedicated and as meaningful The Pinot Chardonnays which we compared of Almaden Beaulieu Robert Mondavi and Wente all possessed breed freshness and sufficient dryness and acidity to put them in the league of the good white Burgundies It was clear that the best red grape variety grown in California is the Cabernet Sauvignon It reaches great heights at Beaulieu Charles Krug Louis Martini and Almaden One fact became clear It takes longer for the Cabernet grape to reach maturity grown in Californian soil than in Bordeaux All of our excellent red wines are therefore being consumed much too young Californians are paying a bottle for Cabernet Sauvignon for two or three years of mature bottle age Our advice to you therefore is to lay down your California red wine Buy it and don\\'t touch it for two years You will be astonished at how excellent a wine you will get when you finally pull the cork We know of no better wine investment (Almaden\\'s current Cabernet Sauvignon can be acquired for the case Lay it away and you will have a $50 wine in short order) Since we have just returned from California and we are now going to press there is not sufficient time to give you a report in detail We are now preparing a brochure called Wine From This Native Soil\" It should be completed by July Page']},\n",

The 1969 vintage is being quoted at opening prices that are 50% higher than the opening quotations of 1966 (You need merely look at the bids fetched for the '69s at the November Hospices de Beaune auction for dramatic evidence - Corton went for over $100 the case without bottling - the highest in history!) The previous outstanding years such as '59 '61 '62 '64 and '66 are either unobtainable or 40% higher than they were a year ago What should you a cost conscious wine lover do?
